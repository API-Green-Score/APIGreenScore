### Description

To reduce the risk of misinterpretation caused by data duplication and streamline the communication process.

Each piece of data should be essential and distinct to the operation at hand. 

Duplicate data can lead to confusion and misinterpretation, as consumers of the API may not be able to determine which data points are relevant or current. 

Ensuring data uniqueness within API responses prevents such misunderstandings and simplifies data parsing and handling. 

By enforcing this rule, we ensure that each API response is concise and that the data provided is a clear and accurate representation of the requested information. Redundant data inflates the payload, increases processing time.




### Example
TBD 

### Validation principle

true of false
