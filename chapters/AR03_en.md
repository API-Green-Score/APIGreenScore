### Description

It is often noticed, especially in large information systems, that an API with the same purpose and objective can exist several times.

These duplicate APIs, in addition to creating confusion in the minds of users, consume additional resources instead of pooling them for a unique API.

It is recommended to use the data catalog to make sure that the API you want to develop does not already exist. If an existing API covers part of the functional scope, it may be worthwhile to contact the producer as it may be possible to plan an evolution of the existing system rather than creating a duplicate.
