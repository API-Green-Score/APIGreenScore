### Description

It is quite common for applications to store a large amount of useless information without time limit.
This results in an excessive consumption of storage services for data that will not be used or no longer used.

It is necessary to clean up the data in order to keep only the data that is useful and to define a coherent retention policy in order to delete them once their validity or exploitation period has passed.



### Example
TBD 

### Validation principle

true of false
