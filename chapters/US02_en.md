### Description

It often happens that the APIs of an information system are rarely or no longer used but are not decommissioned.

This leads to the consumption of computing resources for useless or obsolete components.
It is important that the decommissioning phase is also treated as part of the application life cycle in order to free up allocated resources. In the case of a rarely used API, a root cause analysis should be performed prior to decommissioning to understand why it is not used more often.
