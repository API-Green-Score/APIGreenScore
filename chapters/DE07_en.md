### Description

Sometimes the data returned by an API is structured in such a way that, in order to have all the data the user needs, it is necessary to make several requests to the same API.

This has the consequence of increasing the consumption of bandwidth and computing resources, for the API that has to process several requests, and of bandwidth.

Therefore, it is important to provide a consistent data structure regarding the use of the API. This client-centric best practice prevents the consumer from having to perform multiple queries to retrieve all the information they need.
