### Description

It is quite common to see API backends built to allow database integration. In some cases, these systems are completely redeveloped with data schemas that are not adapted to the usage.

This forces users to perform several queries, often complex, to retrieve all the data they need.

To build an interface to a database, it is recommended to rely on OData or GraphQL technologies that allow consumers to perform complex queries.


### Example
