### Description

One of the structuring questions when designing an API is the selection of the exchange format to use. If the choice is often made by technical constraints or personal affinities, the durability aspect is also to be taken into account.

Indeed, there are exchange formats that are heavier than others. For example, JSON is smaller than XML. The second format will therefore have a stronger impact on the network, the computing and the storage.

In the interest of sustainability, we recommend to use a lighter exchange format to reduce the bandwidth consumed for the requests, the compute and storage resources consumption used to process and store the payloads.
