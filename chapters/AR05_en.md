### Description

Some cloud providers produce carbon footprint dashboards. You can implement your own or adapt it based on your infrastructure to be close to your usage. 

This is not a rule to evaluate API Green score, but it is important to be able to measure the impact on infrastructure



### Example
evaluation of the impact of computing, network and disk divided by the number of calls of the evaluated API.

### Validation principle

true of false
